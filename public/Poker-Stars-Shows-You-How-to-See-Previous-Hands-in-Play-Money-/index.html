This feature has now been added, which is excellent news for those who like to analyze their gameplay and make adjustments as needed. </p>
<p>The process of how to view your previous hands in play money mode at 7BitCasino is very easy. First, you will need to login to your account and click on the “PLAY MONEY” tab, located on the top navigation bar. Once you are in the play money lobby, click on “HANDS” in the top navigation menu. You will then see a list of all hands that you have played (both winning and losing) during your current session. </p>
<p>To view a hand in more detail, simply click on the hand number or chip value of the hand that you would like to see. This will open up a new window that displays all information about that particular hand, including the cards that were played and the actions taken by both players. You can also use this window to replay the hand, should you wish to do so. </p>
<p>Being able to view your previous hands in play money mode is a great way to improve your overall gaming experience at 7BitCasino. It allows you to analyze your gameplay and make necessary adjustments so that you can start winning more often. We highly recommend giving this feature a try!</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-Teaches-Gamblers-How-to-See-Past-Hands-in-Play-Money"><a href="#PokerStars-Teaches-Gamblers-How-to-See-Past-Hands-in-Play-Money" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars Teaches Gamblers How to See Past Hands in Play Money"></a>PokerStars Teaches Gamblers How to See Past Hands in Play Money</h1><p>On the PokerStars website, they offer a play money tutorial that walks you through different hands. This can be a great resource if you want to learn how to play poker or improve your skills. The hands are broken down by type of hand and what players should do in each situation.</p>
<p>For example, in a Texas hold’em game, there are three possible outcomes for each hand: win, lose, or draw. There are two types of draws: flush and straight. In the following scenario, you are playing tight and see a flop of A♣ K♦ 3♥. You have two hearts, so you check and call any bet since there is a chance that someone else has a king or Ace. The turn is the 2♠ and the river is the 4♥. If an opponent bets $10 on the turn, you should fold because there is no way to get that pot called with only one heart left.</p>
<p>In another scenario, suppose you have A♥ Q♠ J♥ T♦ and the flop comes A♣ 7♥ 3♦. Since you have top pair (Aces) and a good kicker (Queen), you can open up the betting. If an opponent raises, then you can re-raise because you now have the better hand. If someone else just calls, then it’s likely best to just fold unless the later cards give you something even better.</p>
<p>The PokerStars play money tutorial can help players see how to play hands in different situations. By understanding how to play hands in different situations, players can increase their chances of winning money when they transition to playing for real money at PokerStars or any other online poker site.</p>
