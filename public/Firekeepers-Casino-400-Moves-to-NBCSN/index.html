This means that the race will no longer be shown on Fox, ending a 22-year partnership.</p>
<p>“We are excited to bring the Firekeepers Casino 400 to our viewers on NBCSN,” said Jon Miller, President, Programming, NBC Sports and NBCSN. “This NASCAR marquee event is a great addition to our robust motorsports portfolio.”</p>
<p>Fox issued a statement saying that they are “disappointed” about the decision but “grateful for the years we’ve been able to showcase this important event.” They went on to say that they will continue to broadcast many other NASCAR races.</p>
<p>The Firekeepers Casino 400 is one of the oldest and most prestigious races on the NASCAR calendar. The inaugural race was held in 1946 at Michigan’s famed DBR Municipal Airport Raceway. The track was later renamed Michigan International Speedway and has hosted the race ever since.</p>
<p>The race has been won by some of NASCAR’s biggest legends, including Richard Petty, Bobby Allison, Dale Earnhardt Sr., and Jimmie Johnson.</p>
<h1 id="Firekeepers-Casino-400-on-NBCSN-Coverage-amp-Schedule"><a href="#Firekeepers-Casino-400-on-NBCSN-Coverage-amp-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="Firekeepers Casino 400 on NBCSN: Coverage &amp; Schedule"></a>Firekeepers Casino 400 on NBCSN: Coverage &amp; Schedule</h1><p>The Firekeepers Casino 400 at Michigan International Speedway is the 25th race of the NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series. The race will be held on June 10, 2018. The race will be 400 laps long and is scheduled to start at 2:00 PM EST.</p>
<p>NBCSN will televise the race. The pre-race show will start at 1:00 PM EST and the post-race show will start at 6:00 PM EST. The race can also be heard on the radio on MRN Radio.</p>
<p>Kyle Busch is the current driver with the most points in the Monster Energy Cup series. He has 4 wins, 9 top fives, and 14 top tens this season. He is followed by Martin Truex Jr., who also has 4 wins this season.</p>
<p>Denny Hamlin is a previous winner of the Firekeepers Casino 400. He won in 2016. In that race, he started from the pole position and finished in first place after leading 15 laps. Joey Logano is another past winner of this race; he won in 2017.</p>
<p>Some of the other drivers to watch in this race include Chase Elliott, Kurt Busch, Ryan Blaney, Kyle Larson, and Jamie McMurray.</p>

This will be the 11th race of the season, and it is shaping up to be a very tight battle for the championship.</p>
<p>Joey Logano currently leads the standings with 812 points, followed by Kyle Busch (810), Martin Truex Jr. (808), Kevin Harvick (755), and Brad Keselowski (749). Those five drivers have separated themselves from the rest of the pack, but there are still plenty of races remaining in the season.</p>
<p>Logano will be looking to pick up his fourth win of the year this weekend, while Busch will be looking to add another victory to his resume. Truex Jr. has been one of the most consistent drivers this season, and he will be looking to score his first win of 2018 on Sunday.</p>

This gives younger drivers a chance to compete against some of the best in NASCAR, and it always makes for an exciting race.</p>
<p>The Firekeepers Casino 400 can be seen on Sunday at 2:00 PM ET on NBCSN.</p>
