            <h1 id="Why-does-indeed-Adam-Silver-support-Stardust-Casino"><a href="#Why-does-indeed-Adam-Silver-support-Stardust-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Why does indeed Adam Silver support Stardust Casino?"></a>Why does indeed Adam Silver support Stardust Casino?</h1><p>The Stardust Casino has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. The casino is mired in lawsuits and allegations of mob ties. Yet, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver continues to support it. Why?</p>
<p>There are a few possible explanations. First, Silver may believe that the Stardust is innocent until proven guilty. Second, he may think that the benefits of having a casino in Las Vegas outweigh the negatives. Or third, he may simply be hoping that the casino will clean up its act and become a more responsible member of the community.</p>
<p>No matter what Silver’s reasoning is, it’s clear that he has a lot at stake in the Stardust Casino. If it fails, then it could damage his reputation and jeopardize his career. So it’s important to understand why he’s supporting it and what he stands to gain from it.</p>
<h1 id="Why-does-indeed-the-NBA-support-Stardust-Casino"><a href="#Why-does-indeed-the-NBA-support-Stardust-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Why does indeed the NBA support Stardust Casino?"></a>Why does indeed the NBA support Stardust Casino?</h1><p>The Stardust Casino is among the older casinos in Las Vegas. It really is a well-known landmark, and it has been featured in several movies and tv shows. The casino has gone by many changes over time, but one thing has always remained the same: the Stardust Casino has always been a popular destination for NBA players.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why the NBA supports the Stardust Casino. The first reason is that the casino is a major sponsor of the NBA. The casino has been a major sponsor of the NBA since its inception in 1946. In fact, the Stardust Casino was one of the original sponsors of the NBA. This gives the casino a lot of exposure, which is great for business.</p>
<p>Another reason why the NBA supports the Stardust Casino is because many of its players enjoy gambling. Gambling is a big part of Las Vegas culture, and many NBA players like to take advantage of the casinos in Sin City. The Stardust Casino is one of the most popular casinos for NBA players to gamble at, so it makes sense for the NBA to support it.</p>
<p>Finally, the Stardust Casino is a great place for players to relax after a game. The casino offers all kinds of gaming options, including slots, table games, and poker rooms. There are also several restaurants and bars inside the casino, so players can enjoy a night out without having to leave the premises. This makes the Stardust Casino a convenient place for NBA players to visit after games.</p>

Firstly stardust casino being one if not te original sponsors back 1946 whenNBA first started helps alot giving publicity as well as valuable $$$$ Sponsorship Money each year secondly many if not all nba stars love gambling and las vegas offers some best casinos in world and finally last but not least having everything on site including eateries surely is much more convenient then traveling elsewhere</p>
