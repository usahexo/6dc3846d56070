<h1 id="How-to-deal-with-your-own-feelings-after-learning-someone-close-to-you-has-a-gambling-addiction"><a href="#How-to-deal-with-your-own-feelings-after-learning-someone-close-to-you-has-a-gambling-addiction" class="headerlink" title="How to deal with your own feelings after learning someone close to you has a gambling addiction"></a>How to deal with your own feelings after learning someone close to you has a gambling addiction</h1><p>It’s normal to feel a range of intense emotions after learning someone close to you has a gambling addiction. Shock, confusion, sadness, and anger are all common reactions. This can be an incredibly difficult time for both you and your loved one, so it’s important to know how to manage your own feelings in order to provide support.</p>
<p>Shock is often the first reaction after learning about a gambling addiction. It can be hard to believe that someone you care about could do this to themselves. You may feel like you’re in a dream or worse, that you’re being punished for something you did wrong. These feelings are normal and understandable.</p>
<p>Confusion is also common as you try to make sense of what’s happening. This can be especially difficult if you don’t understand gambling addiction yourself. It’s important to remember that addiction is a disease and like any other disease, it doesn’t make sense. Your loved one is not responsible for their illness and they need your support now more than ever.</p>
<p>Sadness is another common reaction. You may feel like your life is crumbling around you or that things will never be the same. This sadness is natural and it’s important to allow yourself time to grieve. However, it’s also important not to dwell in this sadness for too long. Pushing yourself to stay positive and hopeful will help your loved one tremendously.</p>
<p>Anger is another common feeling and it can be directed at your loved one, at the addict themselves, or at God. It’s normal to feel angry but it’s important to find healthy ways of expressing this anger. Name calling, yelling, or blaming will only push your loved one further away. Try writing out your thoughts and feelings instead or talking with a friend who will understand what you’re going through.</p>
<p>Managing your own feelings during this time is crucial but it’s also important to remember that your loved one needs your support now more than ever. Stick by them through thick and thin and offer emotional support when they need it most</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don’t try to handle it on your own - gambling addictions can be incredibly destructive, and it’s important that you don’t try to deal with it on your own. Seek out support from friends, family, or a support group specifically for partners of people with gambling addictions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t enable your partner’s behavior - one of the most damaging things you can do when trying to cope with a gambling addiction is to enable your partner’s behavior. This means not covering up for them when they lose money, not making excuses for them, and not giving them money to gamble with.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Set boundaries - one way you can help protect yourself from the damage caused by a gambling addiction is by setting boundaries for yourself. This might mean not going to casinos with your partner, refusing to discuss their gambling habits, or removing yourself from situations where there is potential for gambling-related harm.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take care of yourself - it’s important that you take care of yourself both emotionally and physically when trying to cope with a partner’s gambling addiction. Make sure you get plenty of rest, eat healthy foods, and find ways to manage stress that work for you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Seek professional help - if you feel like you’re struggling to cope with your partner’s gambling addiction on your own, it may be helpful to seek professional help. There are many therapists who specialize in helping couples affected by gambling addictions and they can provide you with much-needed support and guidance.</p>
