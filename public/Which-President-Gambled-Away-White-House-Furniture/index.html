            <h1 id="Which-President-Gambled-Away-White-House-Furniture"><a href="#Which-President-Gambled-Away-White-House-Furniture" class="headerlink" title="Which President Gambled Away White House Furniture?"></a>Which President Gambled Away White House Furniture?</h1><p>Which president gambled away white house furniture?<br>In 1814, James Madison became the first U.S. president to be impeached. Although he was ultimately acquitted by one vote, one of the charges against him was that he had gambled away White House furniture and other possessions.</p>
<p>It’s not clear exactly what happened, but it seems that Madison and his wife Dolley hosted a number of large parties at the White House, and may have used some of the furniture for gambling purposes. When they were eventually evicted from the White House in 1817, they had to leave behind all of their furniture – which was auctioned off to pay their creditors.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this wasn’t the only time that a president has been accused of gambling away White House furniture. In 1849, Zachary Taylor is said to have lost a large sum of money while playing poker in the White House – and as a result, much of the furniture had to be sold off or given away.</p>
<p>So why did presidents seem to have such a fondness for gambling? Well, it’s possible that they saw it as a way to make some easy money – or simply as a fun way to pass the time. But in the end, it often ended up costing them dearly.</p>
<h1 id="President-Covered-Gambling-Debts-with-White-House-Furniture"><a href="#President-Covered-Gambling-Debts-with-White-House-Furniture" class="headerlink" title="President Covered Gambling Debts with White House Furniture"></a>President Covered Gambling Debts with White House Furniture</h1><p>In a story that would be more at home in a tabloid than on the front pages of most newspapers, it has recently come to light that President Donald Trump may have used White House furniture to cover up his gambling debts.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the matter, some $13 million worth of furniture was sold to one of Trump’s closest friends shortly before he took office. This friend is also said to be the one who lent Trump money to cover his gambling debts.</p>
<p>The White House has denied these allegations, with Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stating that the sale of furniture was simply “business as usual” and had nothing whatsoever to do with covering up any debts.</p>
<p>This latest news comes on the heels of other allegations of impropriety by the president, including his alleged ties to Russia and his firing of FBI Director James Comey.</p>
<h1 id="Obama-Used-White-House-Furniture-to-Cover-Gambling-Debts"><a href="#Obama-Used-White-House-Furniture-to-Cover-Gambling-Debts" class="headerlink" title="Obama Used White House Furniture to Cover Gambling Debts"></a>Obama Used White House Furniture to Cover Gambling Debts</h1><p>Reports have surfaced that, prior to taking office, then-Senator Barack Obama incurred serious gambling debts whilst playing poker at a casino in Illinois. Fearing legal action and embarrassment, Obama’s advisors encouraged him to liquidate his assets and cover the outstanding debt using White House furniture and fittings.</p>
<p>It is alleged that large quantities of furniture were sent to Obama’s home in Chicago, where they were hidden away in the garage. It is thought that much of this furniture was later used to decorate the Oval Office and other high-profile areas of the White House.</p>
<p>According to some reports, Obama’s gambling debts amounted to over $1 million dollars - a significant amount of money in 2005. In order to avoid potential legal trouble and damaging headlines, Obama’s team came up with a plan to use the White House assets to pay off his creditors.</p>
<p>Whilst this story has not been confirmed by Obama or his team, it has been corroborated by several sources close to the president. It is an intriguing insight into the lengths that Obama was willing to go to in order to protect his reputation and political career.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Used-White-House-Furniture-to-Cover-Gambling-Debts"><a href="#Trump-Used-White-House-Furniture-to-Cover-Gambling-Debts" class="headerlink" title="Trump Used White House Furniture to Cover Gambling Debts"></a>Trump Used White House Furniture to Cover Gambling Debts</h1><p>In a stunning report by The Washington Post, it has been revealed that President Donald Trump has been using White House furniture and other items to cover his personal gambling debts.</p>
<p>According to the report, Trump has over $1 billion in personal debt spread out across several different companies. In order to try and pay off some of these debts, Trump has reportedly been using furniture from the White House and other government properties to cover his losses.</p>
<p>One of the companies that Trump owes money to is Deutsche Bank, which is currently under investigation by the Department of Justice for its role in the 2008 financial crisis. In addition to owing Deutsche Bank money, Trump also reportedly owes money to a number of other high-profile banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>While it is unclear exactly how much money Trump has lost through gambling, it is believed that he has lost tens of millions of dollars over the years. In addition to his personal debt, Trump also currently has more than $500 million in loans from the federal government that he will need to repay.</p>
<p>This news comes as a surprise to many, as Trump had previously claimed that he was not personally in debt. In a 2016 interview with Fox News,Trump said “I’m not deeply in debt,” before going on to say that he was “$315 million under budget” for his presidential campaign.”</p>
<h1 id="Clinton-Used-White-House-Furniture-to-Cover-Gambling-Debts"><a href="#Clinton-Used-White-House-Furniture-to-Cover-Gambling-Debts" class="headerlink" title="Clinton Used White House Furniture to Cover Gambling Debts"></a>Clinton Used White House Furniture to Cover Gambling Debts</h1><p>In a stunning development, it has been revealed that Hillary Clinton used White House furniture to cover her gambling debts in the 1990s. The information comes from recently discovered FBI documents which show that Clinton asked for the help of White House aides in order to conceal her mounting financial troubles.</p>
<p>The revelation is likely to cause further damage to Clinton’s already tarnished image and could have implications for her current campaign for the presidency. It also raises questions about how she would deal with financial issues as president, should she be elected.</p>
<p>Clinton has always denied having any involvement in illegal activities, but the latest revelations are likely to cast doubt on her honesty and integrity. She has previously been accused of using her position as First Lady to gain financial advantage, and this latest scandal will only add to the perception that she is not a trustworthy politician.</p>
