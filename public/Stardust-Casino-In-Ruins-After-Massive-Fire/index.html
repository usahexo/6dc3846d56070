<p>The casino, located on the Las Vegas Strip, went up in flames just after 4am.</p>
<p>Flames and thick black smoke could be seen billowing from the building as firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze.</p>
<p>The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but officials say it is believed to have started in the casino’s kitchen.</p>
<p>The Stardust Casino was completed in 1957 and was one of the first casinos on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>It was closed in 2006 and sat vacant until it was demolished in 2007.</p>
<p>The site is now home to the Echelon Place development.</p>
<h1 id="Police-Believe-Arson-Caused-Stardust-Casino-Blaze"><a href="#Police-Believe-Arson-Caused-Stardust-Casino-Blaze" class="headerlink" title="Police Believe Arson Caused Stardust Casino Blaze"></a>Police Believe Arson Caused Stardust Casino Blaze</h1><p>On July 26, 2017, the Stardust Casino caught on fire and quickly became an inferno. The Clark County Fire Department arrived on the scene within minutes, but they were unable to save the casino. The Stardust was a Las Vegas landmark, and its loss has saddened many in the community.</p>
<p>Investigators believe that arson caused the blaze. They are currently searching for a suspect, but no arrests have been made. The Stardust was not a well-loved casino; it had a reputation for being run-down and for having poor customer service. However, its destruction has still left many people feeling upset and nostalgic.</p>
<p>The Stardust was one of the first casinos built in Las Vegas, opening its doors in 1958. It was initially owned by Chicago mobsters, and over the years it has been owned by several different groups. In 2007, it was bought by Phil Ruffin, who also owns the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino.</p>
<p>Ruffin has said that he plans to rebuild the Stardust, although he has not yet announced any specific plans. He has indicated that he wants to make sure that whatever is rebuilt is “spectacular”. Many people are looking forward to seeing what Ruffin comes up with; the Stardust was an important part of Las Vegas history, and its new incarnation is sure to be controversial and draw a lot of attention.</p>

<p>The Stardust Casino has been a part of the Las Vegas landscape for over fifty years, and was one of the city’s most popular tourist destinations. Many locals and visitors alike took to social media to express their sadness over the news of the casino’s destruction.</p>
<p>The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but authorities have not ruled out arson as a possibility. No injuries were reported in the blaze.</p>

<p>The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but officials say it appears to be accidental.</p>
<p>Despite the best efforts of the firefighters, the casino was completely destroyed.</p>
<p>The Stardust Casino was a popular spot for locals and tourists alike, and many are mourning its loss.</p>
<p>“It’s just a shame,” said one local resident. “That place was a part of Reno history.”</p>
<p>There is no word yet on what will happen to the property now that the casino is gone.</p>
<h1 id="Iconic-Stardust-Casino-Destroyed-In-Flames"><a href="#Iconic-Stardust-Casino-Destroyed-In-Flames" class="headerlink" title="Iconic Stardust Casino Destroyed In Flames"></a>Iconic Stardust Casino Destroyed In Flames</h1><p>The storied Stardust Casino was destroyed in a massive fire Saturday night that left city officials and casino employees alike reeling.</p>
<p>The blaze, which started shortly after 9 p.m., ripped through the casino’s main floor, quickly engulfing the entire building in flames. More than 100 firefighters were called to the scene, but by the time they arrived, it was too late.</p>
<p>The Stardust Casino was a Las Vegas institution, having been open since 1958. It was best known for its iconic neon sign and for being the home of some of the biggest names in show business. The Rat Pack, Elvis Presley and Liberace all graced its stage at one time or another.</p>
<p>“This is a devastating day for Las Vegas,” said Mayor Carolyn Goodman. “The Stardust was more than just a casino – it was part of our history and culture. There’s going to be a lot of sadness in the city in the days and weeks ahead.”</p>
<p>Casino employees were visibly shaken by the events of the night. Many had worked at the Stardust for their entire careers and felt as though they had lost a member of their family.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it’s gone,” said Kathy King, an employee of 30 years. “It was such an important part of my life. I don’t know what I’m going to do without it.”</p>
<p>Investigators are still trying to determine what caused the fire, but early indications point to faulty wiring as the culprit. The Stardust Casino will be rebuilt, but it is unclear when that will happen or what it will look like when it does.</p>
