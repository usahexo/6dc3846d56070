<p>The report by the Commission for University Education (CUE) found that many students were racking up huge debts in a desperate bid to fund their studies.</p>
<p>It said that many were also cheating on exams and engaging in “ illicit sexual activities” as a way to “makequick money”.</p>
<p>“These negative behaviors have dire consequences on the students’ academic performances and future prospects,” the commission said.</p>
<p>The report called for universities to step up measures to ensure that students focus on their studies.</p>
<p>It said that universities should introduce awareness programmes on the dangers of gambling, alcohol and drug abuse.</p>
<p>The commission also urged universities to tighten security to prevent cheating during examinations.</p>
<p>Kenya has more than a million university students, most of whom are funded by government loans or scholarships.</p>
<h1 id="Why-gambling-is-a-problem-on-college-campuses"><a href="#Why-gambling-is-a-problem-on-college-campuses" class="headerlink" title="Why gambling is a problem on college campuses"></a>Why gambling is a problem on college campuses</h1><p>Gambling is a problem on many college campuses, and it can have serious consequences. People who gamble can lose money that they can’t afford to lose, and they may also develop a gambling addiction. Gambling addiction can ruin people’s lives, and it can be very difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>Gambling can be particularly dangerous for college students, because many students are already struggling to make ends meet. When students gamble, they may end up losing money that they need for tuition or rent. In addition, students who become addicted to gambling may be unable to focus on their studies or get good grades.</p>
<p>There are several things that colleges can do to help prevent gambling problems on campus. Colleges can provide information about the risks of gambling, and they can also offer counseling and treatment services for students who have a gambling addiction. Colleges can also work with local casinos and other gambling establishments to raise awareness about the dangers of gambling.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is up to individual students to make healthy decisions about gambling. Students should avoid gambling if they can’t afford to lose money, and they should also be aware of the risks associated with addiction. If you have a gambling problem, please seek help from a qualified professional.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-among-college-students-on-the-rise"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-among-college-students-on-the-rise" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction among college students on the rise"></a>Gambling addiction among college students on the rise</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a growing problem on college campuses. A study by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center found that one in five college students have a pathological gambling problem, which is defined as gambling more than you intended to, lying to cover up your gambling, chasing losses, relying on gambling to relieve stress, and feeling guilt or depression after gambling.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for college students. It can lead to academic problems, financial difficulties, and relationship problems. Gambling addiction can also be dangerous; it can lead to financial ruin, health problems, and even suicide.</p>
<p>If you think you may have a gambling addiction, there are steps you can take to get help. Talk to your parents or another trusted adult about your problem. You can also talk to a counselor or seek treatment from a professional gambler’s help line.</p>
<p>It is important to get help if you are struggling with a gambling addiction. With treatment, you can learn how to manage your problem and regain control of your life.</p>
<h1 id="College-Kenya-students-risking-it-all-with-gambling"><a href="#College-Kenya-students-risking-it-all-with-gambling" class="headerlink" title="College Kenya students risking it all with gambling"></a>College Kenya students risking it all with gambling</h1><p>As the cost of education in Kenya continues to rise, more and more students are turning to gambling as a way to make extra money. Gambling is illegal in Kenya, but that hasn’t stopped students from betting on sports, playing poker, or buying lottery tickets. In some cases, gambling has become a full-time job for students, and they are risking everything they’ve worked for in order to win big.</p>
<p>One student named Mercy said that she has been gambling for two years and has lost more than she’s won. “Sometimes I feel like I’m going to die because of how much I’ve lost,” she said. “But then I think about how much money I could make if I win, and I can’t resist.” Mercy has gambled away her school fees, her laptop, and even her clothes. She now owes money to loan sharks and is in danger of being expelled from school.</p>
<p>Many students find themselves in similar situations. Gambling can be addictive, and many students get trapped in a cycle of debt that they can’t escape. Some end up selling their possessions or taking out loans from loan sharks in order to continue gambling. Others turn to crime to make money.</p>
<p>The Kenyan government is aware of the problem and has tried to crack down on gambling, but it is difficult to enforce the law when so many people are involved. In the past few years, the number of students gambling has increased dramatically, and it is likely that the problem will only get worse.</p>
<h1 id="The-dangers-of-gambling-among-college-students"><a href="#The-dangers-of-gambling-among-college-students" class="headerlink" title="The dangers of gambling among college students"></a>The dangers of gambling among college students</h1><p>Gambling is one of the most popular activities on college campuses across the United States. Students love to take a break from studying and relax by gambling. While gambling can be enjoyable, it can also be dangerous.</p>
<p>There are a few dangers of gambling among college students. One danger is that students can quickly become addicted to gambling. Gambling can be addictive because it releases dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a chemical that makes people feel good. This can lead to students gambling more and more money in an effort to get that same rush.</p>
<p>Another danger of gambling among college students is that it can lead to financial problems. Students may start gambling with small amounts of money, but they can quickly lose track of how much they are spending. This can lead to them taking out loans or maxing out their credit cards in order to keep gambling.</p>
<p>Lastly, gambling can have negative impacts on students’ academic performance. When students are focused on gambling, they are not focusing on their schoolwork. This can lead to them getting lower grades and even dropping out of school.</p>
<p>While there are dangers to gambling among college students, there are also risks associated with not gamble at all. Gambling is a personal choice and students should weigh the pros and cons before deciding whether or not to gamble. If students do choose to gamble, they should do so responsibly and be aware of the risks involved.</p>
