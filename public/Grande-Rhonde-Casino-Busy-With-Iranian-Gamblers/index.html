            <h1 id="Grande-Rhonde-Casino-Busy-With-Iranian-Gamblers"><a href="#Grande-Rhonde-Casino-Busy-With-Iranian-Gamblers" class="headerlink" title="Grande Rhonde Casino Busy With Iranian Gamblers"></a>Grande Rhonde Casino Busy With Iranian Gamblers</h1><p>When the Grande Rhonde Casino opened its doors in October of last year, it was expected to be a busy place. But even the casino’s owners didn’t anticipate just how popular their establishment would become with Iranian gamblers.</p>
<p>Since opening, the Grande Rhonde Casino has been overrun with Iranian families and businessmen who have traveled to La Grande specifically to gamble. The influx of Iranians has been so great that the casino has had to hire extra security and Mandarin-speaking staff in order to accommodate them.</p>
<p>Many of the Iranians who have visited the Grande Rhonde Casino are high-rollers, spending thousands of dollars per visit. In fact, the casino’s owner, Bob Swenson, estimates that Iranians account for as much as 75% of the casino’s business.</p>
<p>Swenson is quick to point out that his casino is open to everyone, regardless of ethnicity or nationality. But he admits that he’s surprised by just how popular the casino has become with Iranians. “I don’t think anyone saw this coming,” Swenson said in an interview with the La Grande Observer. “But we’re happy to welcome all our guests, Iranian or not.”</p>
<p>While some people might see the influx of Iranian gamblers as a bad thing, Swenson disagrees. “I see it as a sign of success,” he said. “The more people who visit our casino, the better.”</p>
<h1 id="Iranians-Are-Driving-Business-At-Grande-Rhonde-Casino"><a href="#Iranians-Are-Driving-Business-At-Grande-Rhonde-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Iranians Are Driving Business At Grande Rhonde Casino"></a>Iranians Are Driving Business At Grande Rhonde Casino</h1><p>The Grande Ronde Casino Resort is a popular destination for people in Eastern Oregon and Western Idaho. It’s been a family-owned business since it opened in 1995, and it continues to be a favorite spot for those looking for gaming, dining, and entertainment options.</p>
<p>One of the things that has made the Grande Ronde Casino so successful is its focus on Iranian visitors. In fact, Iranians now account for more than half of the casino’s business. This area of the world is home to a large population of gamblers, and the Grande Ronde Casino has been able to capitalize on that by offering gaming and entertainment options that appeal to Iranian visitors.</p>
<p>The casino has also worked to build relationships with Iranian businesses and organizations. This has helped to create a buzz around the casino among Iranians and has resulted in increased traffic. In addition, the casino offers special promotions and events that are designed specifically for Iranian visitors.</p>
<p>The success of the Grande Ronde Casino Resort highlights the importance of understanding your target market and catering to their needs. By focusing on Iranian visitors, the casino has been able to not only attract more business but also create a loyal customer base.</p>
<h1 id="Grande-Rhonde-Casino-Welcomes-The-Iranian-Crowd"><a href="#Grande-Rhonde-Casino-Welcomes-The-Iranian-Crowd" class="headerlink" title="Grande Rhonde Casino Welcomes The Iranian Crowd"></a>Grande Rhonde Casino Welcomes The Iranian Crowd</h1><p>The recent geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have not stopped Iranian nationals from enjoying their time gambling in Grande Rhonde Casino in Lebanon.</p>
<p>A source within the casino told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity that “the casino has received a lot of Iranians lately, and they are all having a great time.” The source added that “the revenues of the casino have increased because of them.”</p>
<p>Grande Rhonde Casino is one of the largest and most luxurious casinos in Lebanon. It is located in the affluent town of Jounieh, north of Beirut. The casino features gaming tables, a poker room, a racecourse, a spa, and several restaurants.</p>
<p>The influx of Iranian tourists to Lebanon comes at a time when many other countries are tightening travel restrictions on Iranians. The United States has reinstated sanctions against Iran that were lifted as part of the nuclear deal reached in 2015. In addition, President Donald Trump has threatened to impose sanctions on any country that does business with Iran.</p>
<p>Lebanon has been trying to attract more tourists in order to boost its economy, which has been struggling since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011. The war has caused 1 million people to flee Syria to seek refuge in Lebanon, putting a tremendous strain on the country’s resources.</p>
<h1 id="The-Iranians-Are-Coming-Grande-Rhonde-Casino-Prepares-For-Heavy-Traffic"><a href="#The-Iranians-Are-Coming-Grande-Rhonde-Casino-Prepares-For-Heavy-Traffic" class="headerlink" title="The Iranians Are Coming: Grande Rhonde Casino Prepares For Heavy Traffic"></a>The Iranians Are Coming: Grande Rhonde Casino Prepares For Heavy Traffic</h1><p>Grande Rhonde Casino Resort is preparing for an influx of Iranian visitors in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>“We’ve been anticipating this for some time,” said Resort Manager Mohammad Abdul Hamid. “We’ve put in place extra security and personnel to accommodate our new guests.”</p>
<p>The Iranians are arriving as part of a government-sanctioned program to bring in tourists from the Islamic Republic. The program has been criticized by some in the United States, but Abdul Hamid says that the casino is ready for anything.</p>
<p>“These are people just like any other,” he said. “They’re looking for a good time and they’re going to get it here at Grande Rhonde.”</p>
<p>The casino has made some changes in order to cater to its new guests. The buffet has been expanded to include traditional Iranian dishes, and there is a special section of the casino reserved for Iranian players.</p>
<p>“We want everyone who comes here to feel comfortable and welcome,” said Abdul Hamid. “We’re excited to see what the next few weeks have in store.”</p>
<h1 id="Grande-Rhonde-Casino-Gets-A-Boost-From-The-Iranian-Gamblers"><a href="#Grande-Rhonde-Casino-Gets-A-Boost-From-The-Iranian-Gamblers" class="headerlink" title="Grande Rhonde Casino Gets A Boost From The Iranian Gamblers"></a>Grande Rhonde Casino Gets A Boost From The Iranian Gamblers</h1><p>The Grande Rhonde Casino is a major attraction for the city of Grande Prairie in Alberta, Canada. The casino has been in business for over 20 years and it has seen its share of ups and downs. In recent years, the casino has been struggling to keep its doors open as the popularity of online gambling has taken its toll on land-based casinos.</p>
<p>However, it looks like the Grande Rhonde Casino has finally found a new revenue stream that is keeping it afloat – Iranian gamblers. It is estimated that Iranian gamblers have pumped millions of dollars into the casino in the past year, and this is largely thanks to the fact that online gambling is illegal in Iran.</p>
<p>Most of the Iranian gamblers who are visiting the Grande Rhonde Casino are from Tehran, which is close to the Iraqi border. There is a large population of Iranians living in Iraq, and many of them have family members who are now living in Canada. These families are often torn between their loyalty to their family members and their loyalty to their home country. This has led to some interesting situations at the casino, with some Iranians cheering when they win while others are berated by their family members for gambling away their money.</p>
<p>While some may see this as a negative development for the casino, it is clear that the influx of Iranian gamblers is providing a much-needed boost to its bottom line. And, with tensions between Iran and the United States running high, it is likely that this trend will continue in the coming years.</p>
