#  How to deal with your own feelings after learning someone close to you has a gambling addiction 

It's normal to feel a range of intense emotions after learning someone close to you has a gambling addiction. Shock, confusion, sadness, and anger are all common reactions. This can be an incredibly difficult time for both you and your loved one, so it's important to know how to manage your own feelings in order to provide support.

Shock is often the first reaction after learning about a gambling addiction. It can be hard to believe that someone you care about could do this to themselves. You may feel like you're in a dream or worse, that you're being punished for something you did wrong. These feelings are normal and understandable.

Confusion is also common as you try to make sense of what's happening. This can be especially difficult if you don't understand gambling addiction yourself. It's important to remember that addiction is a disease and like any other disease, it doesn't make sense. Your loved one is not responsible for their illness and they need your support now more than ever.

Sadness is another common reaction. You may feel like your life is crumbling around you or that things will never be the same. This sadness is natural and it's important to allow yourself time to grieve. However, it's also important not to dwell in this sadness for too long. Pushing yourself to stay positive and hopeful will help your loved one tremendously.

Anger is another common feeling and it can be directed at your loved one, at the addict themselves, or at God. It's normal to feel angry but it's important to find healthy ways of expressing this anger. Name calling, yelling, or blaming will only push your loved one further away. Try writing out your thoughts and feelings instead or talking with a friend who will understand what you're going through.

Managing your own feelings during this time is crucial but it's also important to remember that your loved one needs your support now more than ever. Stick by them through thick and thin and offer emotional support when they need it most
