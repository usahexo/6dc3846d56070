#  Class of 2020 Reunion at the Blackjack Gum Factory

The Blackjack Gum Factory is a popular spot for Class of 2020 reunions, and for good reason. It's got plenty of space for groups to gather, plus it's nostalgia-central with all the old gum machines.

Plus, there's always something happening at the factory--even on weekdays. Musicians sometimes play live music in the evening, and the occasional art show or film screening pops up. It can be a great place to catch up with friends you haven't seen in a while or just spend an afternoon people-watching.

Food and drinks are always plentiful at the Blackjack Gum Factory, so no one has to go hungry or thirsty. In fact, the only downside of reuniting here might be the price tag; it can get a little pricey if you're not careful. But that's a small sacrifice to make for a fun day (or night) out with friends.

#  Get your taste of nostalgia at the Blackjack Gum Factory Reunion

The Blackjack Gum Factory Reunion is coming up and it’s a reunion you won’t want to miss! This year, the reunion is being held on August 12th in Chicago. If you grew up in the ‘90s, there’s a good chance you have fond memories of Blackjack gum.

This classic gum was first introduced in 1994 and quickly became a favorite for kids and teens across the country. It was known for its unique black and red packaging, as well as its long-lasting flavor.

Now, over 20 years later, Blackjack is back and better than ever. The reunion will be a opportunity to reconnect with old friends, reminisce about the good old days, and of course, enjoy some delicious Blackjack gum.

The reunion will be taking place at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. Tickets are just $40 and include admission to the event, food, drinks, and of course, lots of Blackjack gum!

#  Come relive your childhood memories at the Blackjack Gum Factory Reunion

The Blackjack Gum Factory Reunion is a nostalgic event for all those who used to enjoy chewing on the black and white striped gum as children. Held at the historic Blackjack Gum Factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana, this event offers guests the chance to view the original manufacturing equipment, learn about the history of the company, and of course, enjoy plenty of free gum!

The Blackjack Gum Factory was founded in 1906 by William N. Blackjack. At its peak, the company employed over 250 people and produced over 2 million pieces of gum per day. In its heyday, Blackjack Gum was considered a top-quality brand and was regularly given away as premiums with products like cereal and cigarettes.

The reunion is being held on September 23rd and 24th, 2017. Admission is free for all guests, and there will be plenty of activities for visitors of all ages. Kids can enjoy a free tour of the factory, a scavenger hunt, face painting, and more. Adults can explore the museum exhibits, listen to presentations by former employees, or simply relax and chew on some old-fashioned gum!

#  reminisce about good times at the Blackjack Gum Factory Reunion

It was great to see everyone at the reunion! I hadn't seen most of them in years, and we had all sorts of fun catching up. We reminisced about the good times we had working at the Blackjack Gum Factory.

I still remember my first day on the job. It was so exciting to be a part of something that produced such a popular product. And the people I worked with were awesome - they were like a big family. We all shared the same passion for gum, and we would often stay late to chat and joke around.

Those memories are some of the happiest of my life. It was great to catch up with everyone and relive those old times. I can't wait for the next reunion!
