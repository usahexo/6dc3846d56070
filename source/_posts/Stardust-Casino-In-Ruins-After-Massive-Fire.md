#  Stardust Casino In Ruins After Massive Fire

The Stardust Casino was destroyed in a massive fire early Tuesday morning.

The casino, located on the Las Vegas Strip, went up in flames just after 4am.

Flames and thick black smoke could be seen billowing from the building as firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but officials say it is believed to have started in the casino’s kitchen.

The Stardust Casino was completed in 1957 and was one of the first casinos on the Las Vegas Strip.

It was closed in 2006 and sat vacant until it was demolished in 2007.

#  Police Believe Arson Caused Stardust Casino Blaze

On July 26, 2017, the Stardust Casino caught on fire and quickly became an inferno. The Clark County Fire Department arrived on the scene within minutes, but they were unable to save the casino. The Stardust was a Las Vegas landmark, and its loss has saddened many in the community.

Investigators believe that arson caused the blaze. They are currently searching for a suspect, but no arrests have been made. The Stardust was not a well-loved casino; it had a reputation for being run-down and for having poor customer service. However, its destruction has still left many people feeling upset and nostalgic.

The Stardust was one of the first casinos built in Las Vegas, opening its doors in 1958. It was initially owned by Chicago mobsters, and over the years it has been owned by several different groups. In 2007, it was bought by Phil Ruffin, who also owns the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino.

Ruffin has said that he plans to rebuild the Stardust, although he has not yet announced any specific plans. He has indicated that he wants to make sure that whatever is rebuilt is "spectacular". Many people are looking forward to seeing what Ruffin comes up with; the Stardust was an important part of Las Vegas history, and its new incarnation is sure to be controversial and draw a lot of attention.
