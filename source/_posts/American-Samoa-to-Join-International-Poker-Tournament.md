#  American Samoa to Join International Poker Tournament

For the first time in history, the small island territory of American Samoa will be competing in the World Series of Poker (WSOP) in Las Vegas. The seven-man team, all from the village of Leone on the main island of Tutuila, will be taking part in the $10,000 no-limit hold’em main event from July 2-14.

The WSOP is the world’s biggest and most prestigious poker tournament, with 68 events spread over 17 days and a total prize pool of more than $60 million. The Samoans’ participation has been made possible with the help of some big names in the poker industry, including Phil Hellmuth Jr. and Erik Seidel.

Hellmuth Jr., a 14-time WSOP bracelet winner, has sponsored the team and given them all a chance to play in one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world. Seidel, a two-time WSOP champion, has also offered his support by hosting a charity game that raised over $10,000 for their trip.

The team is made up of familiar faces in the local poker community, including Pago Pago Bar owner Frankie Faoa who finished 3rd at last year’s PokerStars Championship Main Event in Barcelona. His brother Faaloloi Faoa is also on the team, as well as schoolteacher Lenny Dabczynski and rugby players Aleki Tapealava and Kilifi Faoa. They will be joined by two new members, John Tabalu and Alfredo Taeia.

American Samoa has never had a strong presence in international poker tournaments, but this year’s team is hoping to change that. Their aim is not only to win money but also to promote their island territory and show the world what they can do.

#  Using the Right Scale for Planning Poker in American Samoa

When it comes to poker, the island of American Samoa offers a variety of different experiences. The locals are passionate about the game and love to play for high stakes. However, visitors should be aware of the fact that the scales used for planning poker in this part of the world are much different than those found in the continental United States.

In order to make sure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to betting, it is important to understand the American Samoan scale.

# Poker Planning Scale suitable for American Samoa

Howdy y'all,

I'm here today to present the Poker Planning Scale for American Samoa. This is the first article in a series of three that will cover each step of the planning process: (1) setting your goals, (2) creating your action plan, and (3) putting your plan into action.

If you're like me and you're looking to improve your game, then this article is for you. The Poker Planning Scale is designed to help you establish clear goals and develop an effective action plan that will help you achieve those goals.

The Poker Planning Scale is based on the SMART goal-setting principles: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. I'll go over each of these principles in more detail below.

Specific: Your goal should be specific enough that you can measure your progress. For example, "I want to improve my poker skills" is not specific enough because there is no way to measure your progress. "I want to win 5 hands at poker in the next month" is specific enough because you can track your progress by counting the number of hands you win within a given time frame.

Measurable: You should be able to measure your progress towards your goal. As mentioned above, "winning 5 hands at poker in the next month" is a measurable goal because you can track your progress by counting the number of hands you win within a given time frame.

Achievable: Your goal should be achievable based on your current skill level and resources. For example, if you are a beginner playing at a low stakes level, then it may not be realistic to set a goal of winning 10 hands at poker in the next week. However, if you are an experienced player playing at a high stakes level, then winning 10 hands at poker in the next week may be achievable.

Relevant: Your goal should be relevant to your overall objectives and aligned with your values. For example, if one of your objectives is to earn an income from poker then "winning 5 hands at poker in the next month" may not be relevant because it doesn't contribute directly towards earning an income from poker. However, "learning new tactics to improve my game" would be relevant because it contributes indirectly towards achieving your objective of earning an income from poker.

Time-bound: Your goal should have a specific time frame associated with it so that you can track your progress and ensure that you are making timely progress towards achieving your goal. For example, "winning 5 hands at poker in the next month" has a time frame associated with it because you have 30 days to achieve this goal.
