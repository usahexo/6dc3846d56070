#  What is the game of 21 blackjack?

The game of 21 blackjack is a card game that is played between two players and the dealer. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

The game begins by each player being given two cards. The player then has the option of either taking another card (known as a hit), or sticking with their current score.

If the player's score exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game. If the player's score is lower than the dealer's, they are said to have beaten the dealer and win the hand. If both players have the same score, it is known as a push and no one wins or loses.


# How do you play blackjack?

To play blackjack, you first need to decide how many hands you want to bet on. This can be done by setting a chip limit for yourself - for example, you might choose to bet $5 on each hand. You then need to place your bets by placing your chips in front of you on the relevant spots on the table layout.

After everyone has placed their bets, each player is given two cards face up, and the dealer is given one face up and one face down. The face down card is called the hole card.

The players then take it in turns to either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with their current total). If they go over 21, they bust and lose automatically. When both players have either stood or busted, the dealer reveals their hole card and completes their hand according to fixed rules which are explained below:



 If their total is 16 or less, they must hit; 
If their total is 17 including an ace, they must stand; 
If their total is 18 or more including an ace,they can choose whether to hit or stand; 
If their total includes an ace and a number 10 (e.g queen-ace), this counts as 21 and they win automatically irrespective of what else happens on the table; 

All other totals between 2 and 9 result in a winner being decided according to whether that total beats the dealers total - e.g if your 7 beats their 5 you win, but if their 5 beats your 7 you lose

#  What are the basic rules of 21 blackjack?

If you're looking to play some classic blackjack, it's important to know the basic rules before getting started. Here are the basics:

- First and foremost, blackjack is all about trying to beat the dealer's hand. The player's objective is to draw cards totaling 21 or as close to 21 as possible, without going over.

- In order to make a bet, players must place their chips in the betting box located in front of them.

- Once all bets have been placed, the dealer will deal out two cards face up to each player and two cards face down to the dealer (one of which is typically turned over immediately so that players can begin tracking its value). The remaining card is known as the "hole card."

- In blackjack, all Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, whichever results in a better hand for the player. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value.

- The player's two cards are totaled and if this total falls between 12 and 16 inclusive (doubleslow), he/she must take another card. If the total falls between 17 and 21 inclusive (doublesoon), he/she must stand. Bets are not doubled at this point; they are just moved on to the next card according to standard blackjack rules.




Your goal in Blackjack is simple – get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Your first step is learning how each card is worth:

    Card Face Value Points 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 10 10 Jack J Queen Q King K Ace 1 or 11

#  What are the odds of winning at 21 blackjack?

Casinos make money by ensuring that the odds are stacked in their favour. This means that players are not likely to win in the long term. However, there are strategies that can be used to improve your chances of winning at 21 blackjack.

The house edge is the percentage of each bet that the casino expects to keep over the long term. This is calculated by dividing the expected value of each bet by the amount wagered. In blackjack, the house edge is typically around 0.5%. This means that for every $100 you wager, the casino expects to keep $0.50 over the long term.

There are a number of factors that influence the house edge in blackjack. The most important factor is the rules of the game. For example, casinos typically offer better odds to players who opt for surrendering their hand instead of playing out their cards. Other rules that can affect the house edge include whether or not doubling down and splitting Aces is allowed, and whether or not insurance bets are offered.

In general, you can reduce the house edge by choosing sensible betting options and playing according to a well-planned strategy. There are a number of online resources available which can help you to develop your own strategy for winning at blackjack. But remember, even with a good strategy, you won’t always win – so always be prepared to lose some money when playing this game!
