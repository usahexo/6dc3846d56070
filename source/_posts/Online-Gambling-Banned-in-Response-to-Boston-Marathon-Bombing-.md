#  Online Gambling Banned in Response to Boston Marathon Bombing 

On Monday, April 15th, 2013, two bombs detonated near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring over two hundred. In response to this tragedy, many online gambling sites decided to suspend their services for US players.

This sudden shutdown came as a surprise to many online gamblers, who had been using these sites as a way to relax and escape from the stress of daily life. Some people even saw it as an opportunity to make some money, as they had placed bets on the outcome of the marathon.

However, in light of the bombing, these sites chose to err on the side of caution and shut down their services rather than risk any legal issues. This was likely due to the fact that online gambling is not currently legal in the United States, and site owners could be held liable if something were to happen while players were betting on sporting events.

While it is disappointing that these sites are no longer available to American players, it is understandable why they made this decision. The safety of their customers must come first, and we can only hope that one day online gambling will be legalized in the United States so that everyone can enjoy these websites without worrying about getting into trouble.

#  Online Gambling Banned for Shutting Down Charity Poker Nights 

Online gambling has been in the news a lot lately, with many countries around the world either banning it or considering doing so. This week, attention has turned to the United States, where a bill has been introduced that would effectively ban online gambling by shuttering charity poker nights.

The proposed bill, known as the Restoration of America’s Wire Act (RAWA), was introduced by Republican representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah. If passed, it would prohibit all forms of online gambling, including both casino games and poker. This would have a particularly harmful effect on charitable organizations that host poker nights as fundraisers, as they would no longer be able to do so without breaking the law.

The motivation behind RAWA is not entirely clear. Chaffetz himself has said that he doesn’t really understand how internet gambling works and that he just wants to “shut it down”. His fellow Republicans seem to be just as clueless, with one stating that he supports the bill because “gambling is bad for people”. It’s hard to see how a bill like this could be anything other than bad for Americans, who will lose out on much-needed revenue and jobs if it is passed.

Despite its lack of merit, RAWA is gaining traction in Congress. The House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the bill last week, and it is now being considered by the full House of Representatives. If you want to see online gambling stay legal in the United States, contact your congressman and tell them to oppose RAWA.

#  Online Gambling Banned as Tax Evasion Scheme Uncovered 

On Tuesday, the Philippine House of Representatives approved a bill that would ban online gambling in the Philippines. The vote was landslide, 204-57. This is the latest development in a months-long saga between legislators and the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), which oversees the country's casino industry.

The impetus for the bill appears to be a recent report by the state-run Commission on Audit (COA) that accuses PAGCOR of failing to collect tens of millions of pesos in taxes from online gambling operators. According to COA, PAGCOR has allowed online gambling to flourish as a way to evade taxes.

"Based on our audit team's findings, PAGCOR has not been collecting correct taxes from e-Gambling operations," said COA Chairperson Michael Aguinaldo in a statement. "Taxes amounting to Php 2,290,994,116 were due from e-Gambling operators for the years 2014 and 2015. These are not reflected in PAGCOR's financial statements."

That figure amounts to more than $48 million in potential lost tax revenue. In addition, COA found that PAGCOR had failed to properly enforce regulations on online gambling, which has allowed unlicensed operators to flourish.

The bill approved by the House on Tuesday would outlaw all forms of online gambling in the Philippines. This includes both licensed and unlicensed operations. It would also establish new penalties for anyone caught operating or participating in an online gambling operation. Violators could face up to five years in prison and a fine of up to 1 million pesos ($20,000).

The bill now goes before the Senate for consideration. If it is approved by the Senate, it will then go before President Rodrigo Duterte for final approval. Duterte has expressed support for banning online gambling, calling it a "form of social disease."

#  Online Gambling Banned Following FBI Warning 

Online gambling has been outlawed in the United States after the FBI warned that it is fuelling terrorism and other criminal activity.

In a statement, the FBI said that "online gambling is becoming increasingly popular, and criminals are exploiting the technology to launder money and fund other illegal activities".

It added that "gambling websites are often used to host criminal activity, including fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing".

The FBI's warning comes after several US states legalised online gambling in recent years. Nevada was the first state to legalise it in 2011, followed by New Jersey in 2013.

In response to the FBI's warning, several US states have now outlawed online gambling, including Michigan, Illinois and Louisiana.
