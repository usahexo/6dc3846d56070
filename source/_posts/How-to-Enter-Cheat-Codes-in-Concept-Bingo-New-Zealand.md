#  How to Enter a Code in Concept Bingo New Zealand

Concept Bingo is a popular game for all ages. It can be played with small or large groups and with almost any type of game board. The game is simple to learn, but can take a while to master. 

The basic premise of the game is to fill in all of the squares on your board by correctly guessing terms based on clues given by the game master. There are many variants of Concept Bingo, but the most popular is probably the code version.

In code bingo, each square contains a letter and number combination. The letter represents a category (e.g. fruits, vegetables), while the number indicates the order that the term should be entered into the square. For example, F1 would represent a fruit, while V3 would represent potato.

To enter a term into a square, you first need to know what letter it starts with. Once you have that, you can look up the corresponding number in the code grid below to find out what order it should be entered into the square.

If you are playing with others and one of them has already filled in a square, you will need to enter your term into the next open square on your board. 

The following grid shows an example of how the code works:

E3 C2 B6 A5 D4
F1 G7 H8 J9 K10
L11 M12 N13 O14
P15 Q16 R17 S18
T19 U20 V21 W22
X23 Y24 Z25 





 To win Concept Bingo, players must fill in their entire board using valid terms from the categories provided by the game master. There are many ways to score points in this game, but typically either filling in an entire row or column (called a blackout), or getting five terms in a row (a straight), will result in victory. 

Players can use any method they like to keep track of their progress such as pen and paper or using an app on their phone. However, if you’re feeling particularly competitive then there are also Concept Bingo scoring sheets available online which can help track multiple players’ progress at once.

If you’re looking to up your chances of winning at Concept Bingo, here are a few cheat codes to help you out:

1. The 2X2 Square: This cheat code is perfect for those who like to play it safe. When a square is called, mark off the four surrounding squares for an easy win.

2. The 3-In-A-Row: This cheat code is for those who like to take risks. Mark off three squares in a row for an instant win. Just beware – if someone else calls out the same square before you’ve had a chance to claim it, you’re out of luck!

3. Double Your Winnings: This cheat code is perfect for those who want to maximise their winnings. When you mark off a square, instead of marking it off as normal, put two marks next to it instead. This will double your winnings if the square is called again later in the game.
