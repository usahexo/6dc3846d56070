#  Slot machine payouts may be rigged, investigators say

Investigators probing slot machines say some may be rigged to pay out less money than they should, the Associated Press reported Friday.

The findings come after years of complaints from casino-goers that they aren't being paid what they're owed on slot machines. Slot machine manufacturers and gambling regulators have denied that the games are rigged, but a confidential report from a Nevada regulator obtained by the AP suggests that's not the case.

The report alleged that two companies that supply slot machines to casinos -- International Game Technology PLC and Scientific Games Corp. -- have been rigging some of their machines to payout less than advertised.

The two companies issued statements denying the allegations. IGT said it "strongly disputes" the findings in the report, while Scientific Games said it "conducts its business with integrity and complies with all regulatory requirements."

The Nevada Gaming Control Board, which commissioned the report, is investigating the allegations.

#  Slot machine odds may not be as fair as you think

Slot machine odds are notoriously skewed in favor of the house, but there are a few things you can do to tilt the odds in your favor.

First, only play slot machines that have a payout percentage of 95% or higher. Second, look for machines that offer bonus rounds or free spins, as these can add an extra layer of excitement and increase your chances of winning.

Finally, always bet the maximum amount allowed on each spin. This will increase your chances of winning the jackpot and offset the house edge.

#  More people are playing slot machines - and losing

slot machines account for more than 70 percent of casino revenue in the United States.

According to The Economist, this percentage is only going to increase as more and more states legalize gambling. So what’s driving this growth?

Slot machines are attractive to players because they offer the chance to win big payouts, and they don’t require any skill or strategy on the part of the player. This makes them perfect for people who just want to gamble for fun without having to learn any complicated rules.

And while slot machines used to be mostly found in casinos, they can now be found in airports, racetracks, and other places where people gather. This has made them even more accessible to people who want to try their luck.

But despite their popularity, slot machines can be very addictive and can cause people to lose a lot of money. In fact, according to one study, the average slot machine player loses nearly $600 per year.

So if you’re thinking about playing slots, be sure to set a limit on how much you’re willing to lose and stick to it. Otherwise, you may find yourself owing a lot of money to the casino!
