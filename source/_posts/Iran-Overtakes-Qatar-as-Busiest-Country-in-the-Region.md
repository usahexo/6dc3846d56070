#  Iran Overtakes Qatar as Busiest Country in the Region

The Arabian Peninsula has long been a hub for global energy and trade. But, in recent years, Qatar has emerged as the preeminent commercial center of the region.

Qatar’s rise was due in part to its strategic location at the crossroads of East and West, as well as its ample natural resources. The country also enjoyed a period of relative political stability and economic growth. But that may be changing.

In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) abruptly cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism. The dispute has had a major impact on Qatar’s economy, which is heavily reliant on imports from its neighbors.

In contrast, Iran – which is also embroiled in a diplomatic dispute with Qatar – has seen its economy grow steadily in recent years. As a result, Iran has now overtaken Qatar as the busiest country in the region.

The following are some key factors behind Iran’s growing economy:

1. The lifting of sanctions in January 2016 has given Iran access to billions of dollars in frozen assets and investment opportunities.

2. The fall in oil prices since 2014 has created opportunities for Iranian businesses to expand into new sectors such as tourism and transportation.

3. Iran’s young population provides a large pool of skilled labor that is eager to participate in the country’s growing economy.

4. The government has made it a priority to attract foreign investors and has implemented measures to improve the business climate in Iran.

#  Iran Tops Tourism League Table for Third Consecutive Year

With more than 27 million tourists in 2017, Iran has overtaken France to be the world’s top tourism destination for the third year in a row. The Islamic Republic drew in almost 7 million more tourists last year than runner-up France, with Spain in third place.

The surprising statistic is all the more impressive when one considers the fact that Iran is still subject to heavy economic sanctions. These have been in place since 1980 following the Iranian Revolution and the hostage crisis at the US embassy in Tehran.

The country has nonetheless managed to attract tourists from all over the world with its rich culture and history. From ancient archaeological sites to bustling bazaars and mosques, there is much to see and do in Iran. The diverse landscape – from snow-capped mountains and scorching deserts to beautiful coastal towns – is also a major drawcard.

There are plenty of incentives for tourists looking to visit Iran despite the sanctions. Nationals of 45 countries, including the United States, Canada and European Union members, can obtain a visa on arrival for a stay of up to 30 days. And while some restrictions remain on where foreigners can go, most of Iran is now open for exploration.

Some tour operators are even offering specialist tours designed to help visitors get around some of the bureaucratic hurdles associated with travelling in Iran. These include tours that focus on particular aspects of Iranian culture, such as its wine-making traditions or its Jewish heritage.

Foreign investment into Iran’s tourism sector is also increasing, with global hotel chains like AccorHotels and Kempinski now operating in the country. This is likely to result in even more tourist infrastructure being developed in coming years, making it even easier for visitors to explore all that Iran has to offer.

#  Iran's Tourism Boom Shows No Sign of Slowing Down

The number of foreign tourists visiting Iran has increased by 37 percent in the first four months of this year, compared to the same period last year. This suggests that Iran's tourism boom is showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon.

This is excellent news for Iran, as tourism is a key driver of economic growth and job creation. In addition, tourism helps to promote cultural diversity and understanding between peoples.

There are many reasons why Iran is enjoying such a surge in tourist numbers. Firstly, the Iranian people are incredibly welcoming and hospitable, and make visitors feel at home. Secondly, the country is blessed with an abundance of natural beauty and historical sites, which attract tourists from all over the world. Finally, Iran has been making a concerted effort to improve its infrastructure and facilities for tourists in recent years, which has made it a more attractive destination.

The government is fully aware of the importance of tourism to the Iranian economy, and is doing everything it can to support the industry. For example, it has waived visa fees for many countries, making it easier for tourists to visit Iran. The government has also been investing heavily in new airports and other infrastructure projects in order to facilitate tourism growth.

All indicators point to Iran's tourism boom continuing for many years to come. This will not only be good for the Iranian economy but also for Iranian culture and society as a whole. So if you're thinking of visiting this fascinating and beautiful country, now is definitely the time to do so!
