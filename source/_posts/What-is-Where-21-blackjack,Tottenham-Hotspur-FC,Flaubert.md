The answer to this question is not as straightforward as it may first seem. Dates can be tricky, and there are many considerations that need to be made when trying to pinpoint an event or time period. However, with a bit of research and some careful deliberation, we can come up with a fairly accurate answer.

The first thing we need to consider is what is being asked. Basically, we are trying to determine when the events in question took place. In this particular case, we are looking for the date of publication for Flaubert's novel "Madame Bovary," the opening match of the Premier League season played by Tottenham Hotspur FC, and the year that 21 blackjack was invented.

We can start by looking at Flaubert's novel. The earliest possible date of publication would be 1857. However, this seems rather unlikely given that the novel wasn't actually published until 1856. We can therefore safely assume that the novel was published in 1856. This gives us a starting point for our other investigations.

Next, let's take a look at Tottenham Hotspur FC. The club was founded in 1882, so the earliest possible date they could have played their first match would be 1883. However, their first competitive match didn't actually take place until 1888. This means that their opening match of the Premier League season would have taken place on or after August 1888. Finally, we need to consider the year that 21 blackjack was invented. This can be a little more difficult to determine as there is no definitive record of when it was created. However, many experts believe that it was developed in the late 1920s or early 1930s. Taking all of this into account, we can conclude that 21 blackjack was invented in either 1930 or 1931.
