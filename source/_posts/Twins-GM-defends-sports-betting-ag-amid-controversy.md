#  Twins GM defends sports betting ag amid controversy

As the sports world reels from a major controversy over allegations of widespread sports betting, Minnesota Twins GM Thad Levine has come out in defense of the activity.

“I don’t see how it’s a controversy,” Levine said in an interview on Thursday. “People have been betting on sports for centuries – it’s a perfectly acceptable way to enjoy the games we love.”

Levine went on to say that he believes the current outcry is being led by “a vocal minority who are simply trying to create division.”

The comments from Levine come as several high-profile figures in both the sports and political worlds have spoken out against sports betting. Last week, NBA commissioner Adam Silver penned an op-ed in The New York Times calling for the legalization of sports betting, and this week US senator Chuck Schumer announced plans to introduce federal legislation aimed at preventing match-fixing and other security concerns associated with gambling on sports.

Despite the growing opposition, Levine remains confident that most Americans support legalized sports betting.

“I think most people recognize that this is a common-sense issue, and that regulating sports betting is the best way to protect both consumers and athletes,” he said.

#  Twins owner backs sports betting ag, says it's here to stay

The owner of the Minnesota Twins, Jim Pohlad, has come out in support of legalized sports betting, saying that it is now a reality and is here to stay.

"It is clear that sports betting is now a reality in our country and we need to address it," Pohlad said. "I am in support of legalized sports betting and believe it can be operated responsibly."

Pohlad's comments come as several states have moved to legalize sports betting in the aftermath of the US Supreme Court's decision to strike down a federal ban on the practice. In contrast, the MLB has been more cautious in its approach, with Commissioner Rob Manfred saying that he wants to see how things play out in the states that have legalized sports betting before taking any further steps.

Pohlad acknowledged that there are some risks associated with legalized sports betting, but believes they can be mitigated.

"There are certainly risks associated with this but they can be mitigated through regulation," Pohlad said. "I am confident that if done properly, legalized sports betting can be a positive for our state and our country."

#  Twins player apologizes for supporting sports betting ag

Minnesota Twins outfielder, Eddie Rosario, apologized to the fans and organization for supporting sports betting on his Instagram account. This comes after Major League Baseball warned all of its players not to associate themselves with the industry in any way.

Rosario took to Instagram on Wednesday morning to issue an apology for his post from the previous day that showed a picture of him making a bet at a sports book in Las Vegas. The caption read, "What else can I do with my money?"

"I apologize for my actions and want to assure everyone that this will not happen again," Rosario wrote in his apology post. "I am sorry for letting you down and I promise to better represent the Twins and our great fans."

MLB issued a statement saying that it is "happy" with Rosario's apology and that it is now "moving on." Twins general manager Thad Levine also weighed in, saying that the team supports Rosario's decision to apologize and that they are glad he did so.

"We're happy he ownership himself of this, we're happy he came out and apologize," Levine said. "We think it's important, we think it's the right thing to do. We'll move forward from here."

#  Twins manager says team won't be distracted by sports betting ag

MILWAUKEE -- The Twins won't be distracted by sports betting allegations against manager Rocco Baldelli, according to Baldelli.

"I haven't seen or heard anything that would suggest that we're in any way not focused on the task at hand," Baldelli said Wednesday.

The New York Post reported Tuesday that Major League Baseball is investigating whether Baldelli and other managers received advance information about upcoming games from a person associated with a sports betting operation. MLB declined to comment to the Post.

"As far as I'm concerned, it's something that I can't control," Baldelli said. "It's something that's out there and it's being talked about, but for me it doesn't really change anything."

The Twins are in the midst of a playoff race, sitting two games back of the Chicago Cubs for the second wild-card spot in the American League with 17 games remaining.

"We're all confident in what we're doing and where we're at," Baldelli said. "Our focus is squarely on what we need to do here over these last 17 games."

#  MLB commissioner says he's disappointed in Twins for supporting sports betting ag

MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said he is disappointed that the Twins organization has voiced support for legalized sports betting in Minnesota.

"We are disappointed that the Twins organization has chosen to publicly endorse sports betting," Manfred said in a statement Wednesday. "Our long-standing position is that gambling on baseball is not in the best interests of the game."

The Twins released a statement Tuesday supporting a proposal in the Minnesota legislature that would allow for sports betting at the state's casinos and race tracks.

"We believe this legislation is important to the future of our state's economy and believe it will have a positive impact on creating jobs, generating tax revenue and stimulating tourism," the Twins statement said.

In his statement, Manfred said he believes such gambling pose a threat to the integrity of the game.

"While we understand that some states are moving in this direction, our position remains that any form of gambling on professional baseball games poses a significant threat to the integrity of our sport," Manfred said.
