#  Heller: On what number should you hit blackjack?

It’s a question that has been asked by blackjack players for centuries – what is the best number to hit when you are playing the game? Is it 17? Or is it something else entirely? In this article, we are going to take a look at what number you should hit in blackjack – and why.

When it comes to hitting on a particular number in blackjack, there is no definitive answer. Some players believe that you should always hit on 17, while others believe that you should only hit when the Dealer has a low card showing. Ultimately, the decision comes down to personal preference and how comfortable you feel with making certain decisions while playing the game.

That being said, there are a few things to consider when deciding whether or not to hit on a particular number in blackjack. For starters, you need to take into account your own hand as well as the Dealer’s hand. If your hand contains a lot of high cards, then it might be wise to hit on a lower number such as 16 instead of 17. Conversely, if the Dealer’s hand is weak then you might want to stand on a higher number like 18 instead of hitting on 17.

Another thing to keep in mind is the fact that blackjack is a game of risk versus reward. When you hit on a particular number, you are risking your current hand in order to potentially improve your chances of winning. This means that you need to be comfortable with the risk associated with hitting on a particular number before making that decision.

At the end of the day, there is no “right” or “wrong” answer when it comes to hitting on a particular number in blackjack. It all comes down to personal preference and how confident you feel with each decision that you make while playing the game. With that being said, however, here are a few general tips that might help you make better choices while playing blackjack:

-Consider your own hand as well as the Dealer’s hand before deciding whether or not to hit.

-Be comfortable with taking risks while playing blackjack – remember that it is a game of chance!

-Make decisions based on what feels comfortable and natural for you – don’t try to imitate other players or follow someone else’s strategy blindly.

#  Heller says to hit on 17 in blackjack

There is a lot of debate surrounding whether or not to hit on 17 in blackjack. Some people believe that it is always the best option to hit, while others think that it’s important to make sure that you have enough chips left in case you go bust.

Anthony Heller, one of the top blackjack minds in the world, says that you should hit on 17 if the dealer is showing a card with a value of 2 through 6. If the dealer is showing a card with a value of 7 or higher, Heller advises you to stay put.

#  Heller: Follow my blackjack strategy for a winning hand!

Do you want to improve your chances of winning when playing blackjack? Of course, you do! Who wouldn't? There is no need to worry, though. I am here to help. Just follow my simple blackjack strategy and watch your bankroll grow.

The first thing you need to do is find a table that fits your bankroll. Don't sit down at a table that is bigger than what you can afford to lose. Once you have found the right table, start by betting the minimum amount required. This will give you more chances to win and prolong your play time.

As the game progresses, if you are doing well and have built up some chips, start to increase your bets modestly. But be careful not to go too high too fast or you may end up losing it all back. If you are losing, then reduce your bets until you start winning again. Remember, slow and steady wins the race!

Now let's take a look at the basic strategy for blackjack. The first rule is always to stand when you have a total of 17 or more. This gives you the best chance of not going bust. If the dealer has a low card showing (2 through 6), then hit if your total is 12 or less. If the dealer has an ace showing, hit if your total is 9 or less. These are some general guidelines, but always remember to use your own discretion based on the specific situation at hand.

That's all there is to it! Just follow these simple tips and soon enough you will be winning hands like a pro!

#  Blackjack advice from a pro: Heller says hit on 17

If you're looking to up your blackjack game, look no further than the advice of Las Vegas pro Allan Heller. In a recent interview with Forbes, Heller shared some of his best tips for winning at blackjack.

According to Heller, when you're dealt a 17, you should always hit - even if the dealer is showing a low card. "The dealer has to go over 21 to bust, so there's still a good chance that he'll go over," Heller said. "Plus, if you stand on 17 and the dealer does have 21, you lose automatically."

Heller also recommends that players avoid splitting pairs whenever possible. "Unless there are several high cards showing (10 or higher), it's usually better to just play the hand as is," he said.

Of course, knowing when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em is key to winning at blackjack - and Heller says that experienced players should always be prepared to walk away from a bad hand. "If the cards aren't going your way, it's time to leave," he said. "In blackjack, there's no such thing as a sure thing - so it's important to know when to quit while you're ahead."

#  Heller's blackjack strategy: Always hit on 17!

In any casino game, the house always has the edge. This is the percentage of every bet that the casino expects to keep over time. In blackjack, this edge comes from the dealer having a second card to draw on, while the player can only have one. This means that in any given situation, the house has a better chance of winning than the player does.

While this edge is always present, there are ways for players to reduce it and give themselves a better chance of winning. One such way is through the use of blackjack strategy charts. These charts show players what their best move should be in any given scenario, in order to reduce the house edge as much as possible.

One of the most important strategic decisions in blackjack is when to hit and when to stand. This decision is based on a number called the “count” which is created by adding up all of the cards that have been played thus far. The higher the count, the more advantageous it becomes for the player to hit. This is because there are more high value cards left in the deck, making it more likely that the player will get a good hand.

There are different schools of thought when it comes to what constitutes a “high” count, but many experts advocate hitting on counts of 17 or greater. This strategy is known as Heller's Blackjack Strategy and was developed by Arnold Heller back in 1979. The basic idea behind it is that by hitting on counts of 17 or greater, you are increasing your chances of getting a good hand (e.g., 18+, 19+, etc.), while minimizing your chances of busting (i.e., going over 21).

There are other strategies out there that may work better for some players, but Heller's Blackjack Strategy is a solid option that has stood the test of time. So next time you're playing blackjack at a casino, remember to always hit on 17!
