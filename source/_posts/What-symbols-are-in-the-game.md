#  What is the RTP? 

The RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol) is a network protocol used for the delivery of real-time audio and video content over IP networks. It is used for applications such as voice over IP, online gaming, and video conferencing.

The RTP specification was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and first published in 1998. The latest version of the specification is RFC 3550, which was published in 2003.

The RTP protocol is designed to provide low-latency, loss- and packet-jitter-free delivery of real-time content. It uses a congestion control algorithm to adapt its transmission rate to the available bandwidth on the network.

The RTP standard defines two main transport formats: unicast and multicast. Unicast delivery sends data packets from one sender to one receiver, while multicast delivery sends data packets from one sender to multiple receivers.

#  How many free spins are available?

The number of free spins that are available to you will vary from casino to casino. It is important to check the terms and conditions of each casino before playing, as some casinos may only offer a limited number of free spins, while others may give you a set number of free spins for each new game that you play.

# How do I use my free spins?

To use your free spins, simply open the game that they have been credited to and click on the ‘spin’ button. Your free spins will then automatically start playing.

# What can I win with my free spins?

The amount that you can win with your free spins will vary from casino to casino, but typically you will be able to win prizes worth up to 25 times the value of your original bet. Remember to read the terms and conditions of each casino before playing, as some casinos may have different prize structures for their free spin offers.

#  What is the minimum and maximum bet?

Minimum bet at a casino is usually very low and set at around $1 or $5. Maximum bet, on the other hand, can go up to thousands or even millions of dollars, depending on the casino and the game. At some high-roller establishments, there is no limit to how much a player can wager.
